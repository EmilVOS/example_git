				<h1 id="gaudi">Barcelona's Architect</h1>
				<p>Antoni Gaudi's incredible buildings bring millions of tourists to Barcelona each year</p>
				<p>Gaudi's non-conformity, already visible in his teenage years, coupled with his quiet but 
				firm devotion to the church, made a unique foundation for his thoughts and ideas. His search
				for simplicity, based on his careful observations of nature are quite apparent in his work,
				from the <strong>Park Guell</strong> and its incredible sculptures and mosaics, to the Church
				of the <strong>Sacred Family</strong> and its organic, bulbous towers.</p>

					<img src="" height="200" width="140">
					<p>The complicatedly named and curiously unfinished masterpiece that is the Expiatory Temple 
					of the Sacred Family is the most visited building in Barcelona. In it, Gaudi combines his 
					vision of nature and architecture with his devotion to his faith. The Sagrada Familia attracts
					even the non-religious to its doors in large part due to its tragic story and its still unfinished
					state, of which the everpresent scaffolding and cranes are permanent reminders.</p>

					<h2 id="park-guell">Park Guell</h2>
					<img src="" height="200" width="140">
					<p>The Park Guell always reminds me of Howard Roark in Ayn Rand's <strong><em>The Fountainhead</em></strong>.
					Gaudi's project in Park Guell was to build residential community whose residents would love 
					where they lived. It was never finished.</p>
					<p>Perhaps that is for the best, since now we <strong><em>all</em></strong> get to enjoy it. The Park Guell
					is set on hill overlooking practically all of Barcelona. Its beautiful and even comfortable
					serpentine bench is filled with foreigners and locals alike every day of hte week. Its 
					mosaic lizards have become synonymous with the city itself.</p>
